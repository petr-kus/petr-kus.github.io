🧑‍💻 QA specialist with over a decade of experience, starting in 2010. I've worked across diverse fields such as security, networking, and scientific applications, testing desktop, mobile, and web applications, as well as firmware closely tied to hardware.

My technical expertise spans high-level programming languages like Python to low-level languages like Assembler, along with scripting in Bash and PowerShell.

💡 I see QA as a complex, multifaceted discipline that goes beyond automation. My work integrates performance, security, and manual testing to provide a holistic approach to Quality Assurance.

🎯 Currently, I’m focused on Robot Framework ecosystem, developing new techniques, tools, and resources to help QA professionals work smarter and more efficiently. 🚀

## This Page
This page serves as a central hub for showcasing my personal projects and technical contributions to the QA community. More importantly, it provides me with a dedicated space to develop and share a comprehensive Test Automation Handbook that addresses the real-world challenges I encounter daily in my work.

The handbook focuses on three critical areas:
- **Best Practices**: Proven methodologies and approaches that actually work in production environments
- **Common Misconceptions**: Debunking myths and addressing frequent misunderstandings that lead teams astray
- **Theoretical Foundations**: The underlying principles that guide effective testing and automation strategies

This resource is designed to be practical and accessible for various audiences:
- Students and participants in my QA courses who need reliable reference material
- Colleagues from my workplace seeking guidance on testing challenges
- Open source contributors and community members looking for proven approaches
- Anyone passionate about improving their testing and automation skills

By consolidating years of experience, lessons learned, and industry insights into one comprehensive guide, my goal is to help QA professionals avoid common pitfalls, build more effective, sustainable testing practices, and extract wisdom from both successes and failures along the way.
